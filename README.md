Data Scientists Have Pinpointed the Age and Number of Smokers in Each State
A recent study completed by a Data Scientist at the University of Denver Data Analytics Boot Camp found that the percentage of the population that smokes in each state ranges in average age from low-30s to mid-40s.

The state with the highest percentage of smokers is West Virginia at approximately 27%. The state with the lowest percentage of smokers is Utah at just below 10%. In most states, smokers make up approximately 14-22% of the population.

The state with the lowest average age of smokers is Utah at approximately 31 years old, but as noted above the number of smokers relative to Utah's total population is the lowest in the country at approximately 10%. The state with the highest average age of smokers is Maine at about 44 years old.

It is interesting to note that the United States has made significant progress in reducing the number of smokers, given the unhealthy side effects of smoking. In 1965, the number of adult smokers in the United States was 51% of the population. As shown in this dataset, that number has dropped by approximately 50% as the number of smokers in each state ranges between 10-27%.
